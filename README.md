## 2021 
Since I'm in the process of learning rust, I thought it would be fun so
try to do this years' [advent of code (2021)](https://adventofcode.com/2021) in
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). It will probably teach me a thing or two
about rust in the process

## Update 2022
Taking Rust a bit further, by only relying on std library (no
additional crates if possible) and functional programming. Benchmarking
runtimes, and minimizing the number of lines of code.

As a bonus, I've also created some solutions in C++;

## Update 2023
I decided to do something different this year, as another year of rust would
become too obvious. In stead, I tried to do something I am far less familiar
with - Bash. Purely for educational purposes.
