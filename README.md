## 2021
Since i'm in the process of learning rust, 
I thought it would be fun so try to do this years' [advent of code (2021)](https://adventofcode.com/2021) in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org). 
It will probably teach me a thing or two about rust in the process

## Update 2022
Taking Rust a bit further, by only relying on std library (no additional crates if possible) and functional programming. Benchmarking runtimes, and minimizing the number of lines of code.
